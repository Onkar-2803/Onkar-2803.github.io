I am a second year Masters student in Computer Science department at the [University of California - San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My research interestes lies in the domain of Machine Learning, particularly Natural Language Processing. I've experience of working on:
- AI for Healthcare
- Low Resource NLP
- Large Scale Data Creation & Curation

 Currently I'm working towards my thesis journey focusing on AI for Healthcare(Perioperative Learning using Artificial intelligence for Timely patient Optimization), advised by [Dr. Gabriel Rodney](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/rodney.gabriel) and co-advised by [Dr. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/), and with the [Dr. Ndapa Nakashole](https://ndapa.us/) as a member of my thesis committee. We work on topics like Prompt Engineering(Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), ReAct Prompting), model interpretability, finetuning Large Language Models. Previously I worked with [Dr. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) and [Mr. Sai](https://sai-ashish.github.io/website/) on a data-reweighting-based multi-level optimization framework for domain adaptive paraphrasing in text augmentation. The work has been accepted in **Scientific Reports (Impact Factor: 4.9)**, in the prestigious **Nature Journal (Impact Factor: 60.9)**. I've also collobarated with [Mr. Aman Chadha](https://amanchadha.com/), curating an extensive dataset for Question-Answering in Hindi and Marathi. 
 
Before coming to UCSD, I did my Bacehlor's at PICT, India. I worked on various NLP projects like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition, Hate Detection, Emotion Analysis, and Document Summarisation. I created the first public major gold standard NER [dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06029.pdf) in Marathi. I have workshop publications at top NLP/ML conferences like **ACL, EMNLP, COLING, AACL, WMT 22 (EMNLP 22), and LREC.**

You can learn more about my publications [here](). You can find my detailed [CV]() here.

I'm excited about connecting with fellow academics! If our research interests align, I'm keen on exploring collaborations or exchanging ideas. Starting **March 2024**, I'm actively seeking **full-time opportunities in the ML/NLP domain**. Feel free to contact me via email if there's a potential match!
